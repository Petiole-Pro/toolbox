# Leaf Greenness Index

## Your time, as a grower, is limited. You have multiple projects you need to complete and dozens of plants to check for Nitrogen deficiency. You don’t have sufficient time to do in-depth research on each plant. You struggle with productivity. We get it. We’ve been there, done that, and on many occasions, we still do it today.

Thankfully, you—(and we)—don’t have to accept this order of things. 
There’s a really practical way you can…
- [x] Capture differences in relative greenness between leaves
- [x] Predict the amount of N fertilizer to recover a high percentage of the potential yield
- [x] Share instantly captured measurements to your team

This isn’t a new expensive chlorophyll meter.
It’s a ready-to-use module - Leaf Greenness Index. It is based on the Dark Green Colour Index (DGCI). This index has been correlated to SPAD readings. In most experiments, corn at the V6 growth stage was in focus. However, it is applicable for any plant. 
The DGCI measurements are converted to relative SPAD values for help with use by researchers familiar with SPAD tools.  When Nitrogen uptake of plants increases dramatically the corrective measures, based on early diagnosis of severe nitrogen deficiencies, can prevent yield reduction and loss.

As your crops grow, you can compare their health using DGCI for any crop under different fertility, fungicide, or foliar treatments. 

Any instantly captured measurements are geo-referenced and can be shared to your team.

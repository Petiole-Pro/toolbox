## Cocoa is a delicate and sensitive crop, and growing it is a hard task, particularly, if you want to plan the future harvest and get information about the fermentation process of your Cocoa beans.

It does not matter how big your Cocoa farm is. What definitely matters - how many Cocoa fruit pods you grow and how well-fermented Cocoa beans you send to dry. Probably, the income of your family depends on these aspects as well. Hence, our Cocoa Toolbox can help you to predict yield by knowing the number of Cocoa Fruit Pods and control the fermentation process from your smartphone.

**Cocoa Fruit Pod Counter** works when you stand still or are in motion. You can get the number of the Cocoa fruit pods in your trees just by walking along your farm!

**Fermentation Checker** will support you in assessing the colour of the fermented bean despite the day of fermentation. Is it reddish brown enough or you have a couple of hours more to wait? 

Are you ready to get more information about your future yield of Cocoa beans and their flavour? Then [leave us](mailto:support@petioleapp.com) your email and youâ€™ll be able to get your Cocoa Toolbox as soon as it will be available in Petiole Pro.

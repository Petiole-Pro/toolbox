## Your plants look green. However, some of them are a bit yellowish. It’s possible that they have Nitrogen deficiency. However, if you don’t have SPAD now, then in a better scenario, you can get access to the device to measure greenness in a couple of days, asking your colleague. In the worst case you’ll never get it. Too expensive, sorry.

We understand your worries and created the Leaf Greenness Index. It can measure the Dark Green Colour Index (DGCI). In other words, you’ll understand the level of chlorophyll in a leaf alternatively to SPAD. However, your measurements can be still converted to relative SPAD values. Hence, no reason to struggle. 

At the same time, there is one IMPORTANT aspect. To be sure that you get the correct measurements, you need to use a colour calibration pad.

Why? Because the camera in your smartphone needs to have a basic set up.

Without this calibration pad, your measurements will be only numbers. However, if you use a colour calibration pad, each of your measurements will be linked to a specific shade of green and vary between 0 and 1 depending on the current level of chlorophyll.
